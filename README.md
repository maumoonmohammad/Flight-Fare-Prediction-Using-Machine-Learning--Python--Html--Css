# Flight-Fare-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning--Python--Html--Css

This project was written in python jupyter notebook. The heart of this project is machine learning where i worked on a dataset taken from kaggle. The dataset taken had flight fares for different locations 
within the country of india. The algorithm used to predict the flight fares is Random Forest regressor. Different data clearning techniques were used including one hot encoding and some of the data columns
had special characters they had to be removed. Grid Cv search was performed to best the best optimal parametrs for the model. The model was then dumped in a pickle file to be used at the backend in flask
app. The front end was designed simply by using HTML and CSS and bootstrap. The front end contains a form and you need to fill in the details accordingly and the output gives us the fare prediction,
